# os-principles

OS is the manager/broker between the resources on your
PC and the different things that would consume those 
resources. Normal OS will do that in one or more of the
following ways:

- Processes, threads and multitasking
Modern PCs are rarely used for a single task, the OS is
the guy behind the curtain keeping track of all the 
resources and states, then scheduling them to run on
the hardware resources when the time is right.

- Memory management 
Most OS have **memory protection**, which allows each 
process access to the memory designated for it. Used in
conjunction with **virtual memory**
