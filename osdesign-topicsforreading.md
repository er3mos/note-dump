## 1. OS Kernel Architectures
    - Monolithic, Microkernel, and Hybrid designs
    - Modular kernel design and loadable kernel modules

## 2. Process & Thread Management
    - Creation, scheduling, and termination of processes
    - Threading models (user-level vs. kernel-level threads)
    - Context switching and CPU scheduling (including real-time scheduling)

## 3. Memory Management
    - Virtual memory, paging, and segmentation
    - Page replacement algorithms (e.g. LRU, FIFO)
    - Memory allocation strategies and fragmentation handling

## 4. Concurrency & Synchronization
    - Race conditions, critical sections, and deadlocks
    - Synchronization primitives (mutexes, semaphores, spinlocks)
    - Lock-free and wait-free algorithms

## 5. Interprocess Communication (IPC)
    - Pipes, message queues, shared memory
    - Sockets and network-based IPC
    - Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) in distributed systems

## 6. File Systems & Storage
    - File system architecture (inode, directory structures)
    - Journaling vs. non-journaling file systems
    - RAID levels and logical volume management

## 7. Device Drivers & Hardware Interfaces
    - Interrupt handling and interrupt service routines (ISRs)
    - Direct Memory Access (DMA) concepts
    - Plug-and-play device driver models

## 8. System Calls & User-Space Interaction
    - Mechanisms for user-mode to kernel-mode transitions
    - Syscall handling, parameter passing, and error handling
    - Security considerations (permissions, capabilities)

## 9. Security & Protection
    - Access control models (DAC, MAC, RBAC)
    - Kernel security mechanisms (SELinux, AppArmor)
    - Virtualization-based security (hypervisors, containers)
